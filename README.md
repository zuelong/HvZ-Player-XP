# HvZ-Player-XP
A Java application to track player experience using magnetic stripe cards.

# Left Column
The left column is a list of all the players i have added to a local database.  I scraped all of their names and ID numbers through a python script I wrote beforehand.  The scaping feature will soon be added to this application.

# Right Column
The right column is for tracking mini-missions created by the moderators.  These are also stored in a local database.
